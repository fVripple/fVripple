Welcome to fVripple. I am your host Ifthekhar Ahammad and this channel is my Vlog to share my hobby and things that I am interested in. 
My hope is to share my enthusiasm with the people who have a similar passion and become educated along with the community. 
If you are interested in Electrical and Electronics Engineer, Hacking, making and breaking random technical stuff, 
learning from my mistakes ðŸ˜…, and combining the knowledge of all branches of applied science then you will feel at home here. 
Constructive criticisms are always welcome as they will help us to grow and learn. And hopefully, 
we will be able to imprint femto level ripple in the sea of knowledge."fVripple" stands for "femto volt ripple".
